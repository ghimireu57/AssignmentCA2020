# 8 If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again.
#Will it change the value. If Yes then Why?

#Value will change assigned to “a” even if they are a different data type because python automatically takes
# care of the physical representation for the different types of data i.e an integer values will be stored in different
# memory locations than a float or a string.
